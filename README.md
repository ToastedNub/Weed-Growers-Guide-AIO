# Dirt
 - The best dirt to use it [PH Pro Mix](https://www.pthorticulture.com/en-us/products/pro-mix-hp-mycorrhizae).
 - Optionally you can use any aerated dirt.
 - If the mix you get does not have [Pearlite](https://a.co/d/hRI8myV) or [Mycorrhizae](https://a.co/d/87OXRf9), then you need to get those as well.
 - You will want [Worm Castings](https://a.co/d/2gGIPZO) or any other animal waste to help boost the plants growth.
 - Be sure to mix everything, you do not want clumps in the dirt when you plant the seeds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Nutrients
 - For your plant to grow as healthy as it can during the Vegging Stage, you will want to use [Gaia Green All Purpose](https://a.co/d/iAh2A5G), or any approved 4-4-4 mix.
 - For the Flowering Stage you will want to use [Gaia Green Power Bloom](https://a.co/d/1zMfADi), or any approved 2-8-4 mix.
 - You will want to flush your plant of all nutrients before harvest, meaning water it without giving it any nutrients for the last 3-4 weeks of flower.
 - You will also want to use [Worm Castings](https://a.co/d/2gGIPZO) or any other animal waste for every feeding, this will boost plant growth.
 - You do not want to use liquid or synthetic nutrients, that can lead to nutrient burn in your plant, and can often lead to the plant just dying completely.
 - Feed your plants the recommended ammount on the package, every 4 weeks.
 - Do not feet your for the last 4-6 weeks of flower.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Seeds
 - From my own experience, [Canuk Seeds](https://www.canukseeds.com) has the best seeds overall, and the biggest inventory.
 - Make sure when you buy a seed that it is femenized, unless you want a male plant for breeding.
 - Optionally you can find seeds in some buds, after you grind your weed, you can sometimes find some unbroken seeds mixed in.
 - The seeds you get from picking out of your weed will not be femenized, they can either be male or female.
 - Sadly the only way to accurately tell if your plant is male or female is once it starts to flower.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Indoor Equipment (TENTS)
 - You will need a [Grow Tent](https://a.co/d/81edLpz), you don't need any spicific size, but 3ftx3ftx6ft is abt the smalles you should go.
 - You will also need an [Inline Fan](https://a.co/d/0YcUl5h).
 - You will need a [Carbon Filter](https://a.co/d/eSbCpYb) for the Inline Fan, this will soak the smell of the plants, so you won't smell anything.
 - If you are not able to directly connect the Inline Fan to one of the holes in the tent, then you will need [Inline Tubing](https://a.co/d/dvrgDDD), so the Inline Fan can bring outside air into the tent.
 - You will also need some gind of [LED Grow Light](https://a.co/d/8ablxWW), it doesn't really matter what one, but the higher the wattage, and the more coverage it has, the better.
 - You need grow pots, either fabric or plastic work best, you will also need plant pot trays, these will hold any water spills, I find that 3-5 gallon pots are better for indoor plants.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Planting
 - Your seed should be planted about 1cm deep.
 - Lightly cover your seed with dirt, some seeds will not sprout if they are in any light.
 - Keep the area where you planted the seed moist, you can keep it more moist by putting a see through plastic cup, or container over it.
 - When the plant comes up out of the dirt, keep the dirt around it moist for the fitst 1-2 weeks, but do not flood the plant, you want the roots to grow as much as they can as soon as they can.
 - Once your plant grows its first [Weed Leaves](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/616f6be3d6452d0243ff3cd3/512c1df1-2fc7-451a-8086-209306dd4285/cannabis+germination), this means you can take off any container or cup you had on, the plant will be fine on its own.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vegging & Flowering Control
 - If you have a photoperiod plant, then it will flower based off it's light cycle, its best to plant these early spring.
 - If you have an autoflowering plant, these will automatically flower within a few months.
 - If you are growing in a tent, proper lighting for vegging is 16h on, 8h off, flowering is 12h on, 12h off, this only works for a photoperiod plant.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Cloning
 - You can clone a weed plant by cutting off a stem, the stem needs to have at least 3 nodes above where you cut.
 - Cut most of the leaves off so the stem doesn't kill itself trying to use its energy, but leave a few leaves at the top.
 - Make sure the cut at the bottom of the stem is close to a 45 degree angle.
 - Put the stem in a cup of water.
 - Wait a few days for the stem to grow small roots.
 - Plant the stem in a pot of dirt.
 - This wont always work, it's best to do it with at least 2 stems, it will almost always work, but it's also easy to over stress the new stem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Training
 - Wait until your plant is tall enough, it needs to have 3-4 nodes.
 - You will see a little leaf at the very top of each top branch, cut those off before they grow into a stem, this will make it grow as 2 stems instead of 1.
 - You can do this to the same stems each time the leaves grow back, and the stems will multiply each time.
 - Once multiple stems grow out of a spot you cut, you can cut the leaves on the top of those stems when they're big enough, to make them grow more as well.
 - If you train a plant too much, it will need to be pruned or it will go moldy, or some branches will die during flower from lack of airflow and light.
 - Training is best for indoor plants, because that way you can control when your plant will flower entirely.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pruning
 - You want to cut off any suckers (the main stem will grow branches off of it, you dont want a third stem coming out between the main stem and a branch).
 - [Optionally you can cut off all the lower leaves, and leave only the top ones](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/img/cms/flowering_1.jpg), do this a few weeks before flower, this will make it grow less buds, but they will be bigger, and if you trained it properly, it will actually grow more than it would normally by doing this.
 - Pruning is best for indoor plants, because that way you can control when your plant will flower entirely.
 - Don't prune too much too fast, you can stunt your plants growth, meaning it will stop all growth until it's no longer stressed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When To Harvest
 - Harvest time is up to you depending on what you want the effect to be when you smoke it.
 - Most of the effect relies on the plants genetics, which determines weather its an indica or a sativa, hybrids are a mix of the two, there really is no accurate way to tell what % of what a hybrid is, all marketing that claim to know the % are simply lying.
 - You will want to look at the [Trichomes](https://dutch-passion.com/img/cms/Blogs/Cannabis-trichomes-colours(1).jpg) on the buds of your plant.
 - You do not want to harvest if the trichomes are white and clear.
 - If the trichomes are white and cloudy, this is a good time to harvest if you want a mora sativa feel from it.
 - For a more indica feel, you would want to wait until some of the trichomes turn an amber/brown color, you will want about 40% of them to go brown, too much and it ruins the high.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How To Harvest # Dry
 - To harvest weed, you want to cut the whole plant as one peice, at the very bottom of the stem, right above the dirt.
 - You waill want to hang the plant upside down in a clean place, away from heavy moisture or anything that could cause mold.
 - You want to check the plant every few days so it doesnt get too dry, that will ruin the flavor, so will drying too fast, air drying is the best method.
 - You know the weed is ready to trim and put into jars or bags when all of the thin stems snap when you bend them, instead of just bending, you will hear a snap.
 - Cut off all the leaves, and stems, and put your weed in a safe place to store it.
 - For the best flavor, smoke, and high from your weed, you will want to make the drying time last between 12-16 days, you might need a small humidifier on the other end of the room to do that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How To Cure
 - To cure weed, put it in a jar or a bag with a [Hygrometer](https://a.co/d/904cqXv) and a [62% Moisture Pack](https://a.co/d/8FLomYu).
 - You want your weed to stay around 58% - 64% humidity, anything over and you will need to take the weed out, and let it dry more first.
 - For the best cure, you will want to keep your weed in a closed jar for 2-4 months, this will make it smell and taste better, along with raise its potency very slightly.
 - You want to keep the jar closed the entire cure, the more you open it, the more you ruin the cure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Stress & Males
 - If you stress your plant enough, it will become a hermaphrodite (both male and female).
 - Once a plant goes hermaphrodite, you can not let the pollen get into your other buds or plants, unless you want them to be filled with seeds.
 - A male weed plant will not grow buds, it will only grow pollen sacks, and a hermaphrodite can grow nanners.
 - Realistically you should kill any hermaphrodite plant, as it's difficult to keep them healthy and keep cutting off the male bits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pollen Sacs
 - Pollen sacs are part of the male plant, basically the balls of the plant, these store pollen to later be released during flower.
 - The pollen is good for breeding plants, it can also be harvested and frozen to manually breed a plant.
 - You should cut these off if you ever see them on a female plant.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Nanners
 - Pollen sacs are part of the male plant, basically the penis of the plant, these store pollen to later be released during flower.
 - Nanners will mainly grow on a plant for 1 reason, that reason is that a plant nearby had pollen sacs, and the nanners are a result of getting pollenated.
 - A nanner will not open, but they are not hard to miss, they look like bananas.
 - You should cut these off if you ever see them on a female plant.
